    ### Three Different Fault-tolerant Quantum Computers (FTQC) System Configurations:
    - **Practical FTQC:** Based on IBM’s expectations for its System Two in the ~2027+ timeframe; 200 logical qubits and a ratio of 500 physical qubits per logical qubit; target logical error rate of 10^-7; less optimistic assumptions for cryogenics and control electronics. 
    - **Full FTQC (Small):** Based on IBM’s expectations for its System Two in the ~2033+ timeframe; 2,000 logical qubits and a ratio of 1,000 physical qubits per logical qubit; target logical error rate of 10^-12; more optimistic assumptions for cryogenics and control electronics. 
    - **LFull FTQC (Large):** An expansion of the Small Full FTQC; larger cryo-chambers (Fermilab Colossus–class volumes); 5,000 logical qubits and a ratio of 2,000 physical qubits per logical qubit; target logical error rate of 10^-15; significantly more optimistic assumptions for cryogenics (e.g., much higher qubit densities per cryo-chamber)

    Scenarios for national-scale deployment of a fleet of Quantum-Accelerated Computing Infrastructure (QuACI) systems throughout the US from the 2030s into the 2040s:
    - **Low Penetration:** 10% rate of integrating quantum computers into classical computing data centers over time.
    - **High Penetration:** 100% rate of integrating quantum computers into classical computing data centers over time.

    - **US Quantum R&D Centers:** Locations of federal quantum research centers in the United States involved in quantum computing R&D from Center for Strategic & International Studies (https://www.csis.org/analysis/innovation-lightbulb-us-federal-investments-quantum-technology-research-and-infrastructure).
    - **US Commercial Data Centers:** Locations of US commercial data centers up until mid-2025 from S&P Global Research Datacenter KnowledgeBase.
